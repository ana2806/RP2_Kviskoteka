# Kviskoteka

## Description
The task was to implement the popular game Kviskoteka in programming language C#. It consists of three parts: "ABC Quiz Game", "Association Game" and "Detection Game". The player plays against two computer opponents. The goal is to collect as many points as possible. Each player can win _Kvisko_, which gives him doubling points if he offers the exact answer. The winner is the player who has the highest points at the end of the third game.  
The game is implemented in the C # program language, using Windows Forms, within the Visual Studio programming environment. Five forms are used, one for the initial game interface (main menu), three for games (one for each game) and one for final display of results.
